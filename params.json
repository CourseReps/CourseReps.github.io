{"name":"CourseReps","tagline":"A Collection of Repositories for Project-Based Learning","body":"# Project-Based Learning\r\n\r\nProject-based courses are first and foremost a community and a culture.\r\nThey offer an outlet for creativity for students with inquisitive minds.\r\nThey also provide a learning experience where participants are asked to research, contribute and share.\r\nThis initiative seeks to leverage student enthusiasm and skills into building original projects.\r\nIn the process, they are exposed to efficient design strategies and the latest technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nWhile enrolled in engineering programs, it is crucial for students to develop several facets of their professional profiles.\r\nImportant dimensions of their education include teamwork, programming and marketing skills, time management and leadership.\r\nProject-based learning complements the traditional classroom experience with weekly business meetings and an environment akin to the workplace.\r\nIt includes frequent workshops centered around particular topics.\r\n\r\nIn addition, participants are involved in design projects.\r\nEach project explores a fundamental concept in electrical and computer engineering.\r\nStudents are accountable for design decisions, progress reports and they must produce deliverables upon completion of every phase of their projects.\r\nAltogether, this offers an exceptional opportunity for students to work on all aspects of their future career.\r\nKey to the success of this initiative is the creation of a knowledge culture where participants share their respective expertise with one another, and where more experience members train other participants.\r\nThis initiative is a good example of a situation where establishing the right culture supersedes the formal teaching of students.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tutorials\r\n\r\nStudents who partake in this initiative are expected to generate concise tutorials on the techniques, software applications and platforms frequently employed in project-based learning.\r\nThis in itself is a valuable learning experience and it benefits future generations of participants by helping them get started with various aspects of their projects.\r\nIn this sense, this initiative subscribes to a teaching philosophy that strives to align deliverables and valuables.\r\n","google":"UA-7761657-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
