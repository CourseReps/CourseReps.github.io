# Project-Based Learning

Project-based courses are first and foremost a community and a culture.
They offer an outlet for creativity for students with inquisitive minds.
They also provide a learning experience where participants are asked to research, contribute and share.
This initiative seeks to leverage student enthusiasm and skills into building original projects.
In the process, they are exposed to efficient design strategies and the latest technologies.


## Rationale

While enrolled in engineering programs, it is crucial for students to develop several facets of their professional profiles.
Important dimensions of their education include teamwork, programming and marketing skills, time management and leadership.
Project-based learning complements the traditional classroom experience with weekly business meetings and an environment akin to the workplace.
It includes frequent workshops centered around particular topics.

In addition, participants are involved in design projects.
Each project explores a fundamental concept in electrical and computer engineering.
Students are accountable for design decisions, progress reports and they must produce deliverables upon completion of every phase of their projects.
Altogether, this offers an exceptional opportunity for students to work on all aspects of their future career.
Key to the success of this initiative is the creation of a knowledge culture where participants share their respective expertise with one another, and where more experience members train other participants.
This initiative is a good example of a situation where establishing the right culture supersedes the formal teaching of students.


## Tutorials

Students who partake in this initiative are expected to generate concise tutorials on the techniques, software applications and platforms frequently employed in project-based learning.
This in itself is a valuable learning experience and it benefits future generations of participants by helping them get started with various aspects of their projects.
In this sense, this initiative subscribes to a teaching philosophy that strives to align deliverables and valuables.
